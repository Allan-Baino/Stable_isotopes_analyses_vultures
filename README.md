**Brief overview**: Vultures are obligate scavenging birds that provide essential ecosystem services such as nutrient recycling and disease regulation however, 
they are among the most threatened taxa of birds (CR, IUCN Red List, 2024). Threats to their survival include poisoning and correlated effects of habitat loss and
food availability. Understanding their diet can among other things play an important role in identifying feeding locations frequented by vultures which can be useful
in delineating poisoning susceptibility.
